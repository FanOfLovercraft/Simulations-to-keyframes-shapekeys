Blender Addons that creates a set of shape keys and keyframes based on physic modifier.

Cloth/Soft body - choose which modifier will be used to make keys

First frame - frame where a first key will be added

Last frame - the last frame where a shapekey can be added(depends on step)

Step - how often keys are added(step= 5 -> Frame 0 5 10 etc..)

I made it because I wanted to make an animation that included several deformations a bit too complex for a single shape key and physics were a bit too much for this.
It's my first ever add-on so there may be bugs or sth lacking. Please inform me if it is something critical
